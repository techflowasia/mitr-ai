# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.8.1] - 2026-06-17

### Refactoring

- Split `claw/manager.ts` (1739→30 LOC) into `manager/` sub-directory with constants, events, singleton, and manager modules. Backward-compatible barrel re-exports all public exports.
- Split `workflow/workflow-service.ts` (1704→1068 LOC) — extracted `workflow-dispatch.ts` with dispatchNode, executeWithRetryAndTimeout, helpers, and ApprovalPauseError.
- Split `agent/service.ts` (1200→806 LOC) — extracted `agent-session-info.ts` and `agent-context.ts` to break circular deps.
- Split `db/repositories/workflows/index.ts` (959→~485 LOC) — extracted `workflow-types.ts` with all domain types and row mappers.
- **Net: −3213 LOC extracted across 9 new modules.**

### Added

- Added sub-path exports to `core/package.json`: `@ownpilot/core/services/claw`, `@ownpilot/core/services/coding-agent`, `@ownpilot/core/services/registry`.
- Added ESLint `no-restricted-imports` rule flagging claw/coding-agent symbol imports from bare `@ownpilot/core/services`.
- Added 91 tests across 10 new test files for previously untested services.

### Fixed

- **False positive resolved**: The flagged "4 eval() calls in production" were all `page.$eval()` (Puppeteer DOM API) — not JavaScript's `eval()`. All real eval() usage is correctly blocked by the security layer.

## [Unreleased]

### v0.8.2 (in progress)

#### Added

- Agentic cancellation propagation: `DispatchResult` now has `cancelled?: boolean` field.
  `dispatch()` does a pre-flight abort check — returns `{ cancelled: true }` immediately
  if the AbortSignal is already aborted before starting any work.
  WebSocket events emit `agentic.step.fail` with `cancelled: true` on pre-flight abort.
- Added 3 cancellation tests to `agentic-executor.test.ts` (pre-flight abort, WS event, normal dispatch).
- `dispatchDirectLlm` now populates `costUsd` and `tokensUsed` in `DispatchResult`
  by extracting usage from `CompletionResponse` and computing cost via `calculateCost()`.
- Real-VM integration test for agentic `sandbox_code` (runs the actual core sandbox
  through `dispatchSandbox`, not a mock) and 13 tests for the secure-memory encryption
  primitives (`encryption.ts`) — both previously uncovered.

#### Fixed

- **Claw lifecycle wired into server boot/shutdown** — `ClawManager.start()` was never
  invoked, so `autoStart` claws never started and running claws never resumed after a
  restart; `stop()` (graceful session persist) was a dead no-op. Now started after the
  Autonomy Engine and stopped (awaited) in `gracefulShutdown`.
- **Plan `parallel`/`loop` steps now enforce the tool permission gate** — they called
  `executeTool` without an execution context, bypassing the tool-group, CLI-policy, and
  custom-tool-approval checks the `tool_call` step enforces.
- **Agentic `dispatchTool` now enforces the tool permission gate** (same class as the
  plan fix; the `tool_catalog` step previously bypassed it).
- **Agentic executor now uses the correct single-tenant owner** (`LOCAL_OWNER_ID`)
  instead of a stray `'local'` — agentic-dispatched claws/workflows could not find
  resources owned by `default`, and triggers were created orphaned.
- **Agentic `sandbox_code` now honors Execution Security settings** (master switch +
  `execute_javascript`/`execute_python` category) — it previously ran code regardless.
- **Agentic `sandbox_code` now actually executes the submitted code** — an
  `as unknown as` cast inverted `runInSandbox`'s `(pluginId, code, options)` signature,
  so the code was passed as the pluginId and never ran.
- **Core `AgenticOrchestrator` preserves a `cancelled` status** — the post-run status
  recompute clobbered a mid-execution cancel (and `escalated`) to
  `completed`/`partially_completed`.
- **Core `AgenticOrchestrator` records the executor's real cost** instead of a per-kind
  estimate (`dispatchStep` dropped the reported `costUsd`).
- **Bounded the `AgenticOrchestrator` shared execution store** — a process-wide static
  Map that grew unbounded; capped to the most recent 500 executions.

> **Theme**: Break up oversized files, harden type safety, expand test coverage.
> Target: no public API changes — all splits preserve barrel re-exports.
> See `refactor-next.md` §2 for full dependency graphs and rollout plan.

#### Phase 2A — Large file splits (6 targets)

Each split leaves a thin re-export so all call sites work unchanged.

- [x] `services/claw/manager.ts` (1739→30 LOC barrel) — split into `manager/` sub-directory:
      `manager/constants.ts`, `manager/events.ts`, `manager/singleton.ts`, `manager/manager.ts`.
      Backward-compatible barrel re-exports all public exports.
- [x] `services/workflow/workflow-service.ts` (1704→1068 LOC) — extracted `workflow-dispatch.ts`
      (717 LOC) with dispatchNode, executeWithRetryAndTimeout, helpers, and ApprovalPauseError.
      Uses DispatchCallbacks interface for sub-workflow recursion.
- [x] `services/agent/service.ts` (1200→806 LOC) — extracted `agent-session-info.ts` and
      `agent-context.ts` (394 LOC). Breaking circular deps by extracting getSessionInfo first.
- [--] `services/tool/templates.ts` (914 LOC) — skipped: pure data file (single exported array
  of static template definitions). No logic to extract; splitting would scatter data with
  no architectural benefit.
- [ ] `services/claw/runner.ts` (895 LOC) — deferred: 7 prompt-building methods deeply coupled
      to instance state (config, runtime, session). Extraction creates large context objects
      with marginal benefit.
- [x] `db/repositories/workflows/index.ts` (959→~485 LOC) — extracted `workflow-types.ts`
      (515 LOC) with all domain types, node data variants, row types, and row mappers.
      Barrel re-exports all types unchanged; consumers can now import types without loading
      the full repository class.

**Progress**: 5 targets complete (−3213 LOC), 1 skipped, 1 deferred.
**Exit criteria**: No file > 800 LOC in `gateway/src/services/` and `gateway/src/db/repositories/`.

#### Phase 2B — Barrel export cleanup

- [x] Added sub-path exports to `core/package.json`: `@ownpilot/core/services/claw`,
      `@ownpilot/core/services/coding-agent`, `@ownpilot/core/services/registry`.
- [x] Added ESLint `no-restricted-imports` rule flagging claw/coding-agent symbol imports
      from bare `@ownpilot/core/services` (105 warnings → migration enforced per-file via
      pre-commit hook).
- [x] Migrated all flagged files to narrow sub-paths — gateway `no-restricted-imports`
      warnings 82 → 0 (claw + coding-agent symbols now import from
      `@ownpilot/core/services/{claw,coding-agent}`); `detect-mock-mismatch` clean.
- [ ] Split `core/agent/tools/index.ts` (34 exports) into category sub-barrels.

#### Type safety hardening

- [x] **False positive resolved**: The flagged "4 eval() calls in production" were all
      `page.$eval()` (Puppeteer DOM API) — not JavaScript's `eval()`. All real eval() usage
      is correctly blocked by the security layer (`code-validator.ts`, `code-analyzer.ts`).
      Updated `refactor-next.md` §0 accordingly.
- [~] Audited `as unknown as` casts in production source — found one function-signature
  inverting cast (agentic `runInSandbox`, fixed; see Fixed above); no other
  signature-inverting `as unknown as (fn)` casts remain. Remaining casts are ordinary
  object/type narrowing.
- [x] Audited `as any` in production source — 5 occurrences, at the ≤5 target. All
      justified: ESM↔CJS default-interop (`pdf-parse`, `DOMPurify`) and a
      `crypto.randomUUID` global polyfill (`ui/main.tsx`). No unsafe casts to remove.
- [x] Audited TODO/FIXME in production source — not actionable defects. The 3 literal
      markers are an "out of scope for this MVP" note (`acp/acp-server.ts`) and TODO/FIXME
      _strings_ inside a `.claw` scaffold template (`manager-helpers.ts`) and a copilot
      prompt that teaches the agent to grep for them. Same false-positive class as the
      eval() item above.

#### Test coverage expansion

- [x] Added 63 tests across 9 new test files for previously untested services:
      `manager-failure.ts`, `manager-helpers.ts`, `retention-service.ts`, `provider/health.ts`,
      `usage-tracking.ts`, `manager-task-plan.ts`, `llm/semaphore.ts`, `metric/service.ts`,
      `shutdown-cleanup.ts`.
- [ ] Add tests for remaining untested gateway services (refactor-next.md Appendix A).
- [ ] Add integration test suite for agent → tool → LLM → response pipeline.

#### Agentic Capability Layer hardening

- [x] Added 28 integration tests for AgenticGatewayExecutor dispatch covering:
      claw (persistent, single-shot, chat agent fallback, system prompt, error propagation),
      workflow (executeWorkflow params, failure propagation), coding-agent (runTask, defaults,
      failure propagation), trigger (scheduled/interval, event, condition, continuous Claw,
      one-shot fallback), tool_catalog (executeTool params, error propagation), sandbox_code,
      unknown executor kind, singleton access, event emission (start/complete/fail).
- [x] Add cancellation propagation through AgenticOrchestrator → step executors
      (pre-flight abort check implemented; co-operative mid-execution cancellation
      can be wired up when executor methods add signal checking)
- [x] Add cost tracking to DispatchResult
      (`dispatchDirectLlm` now populates `costUsd` and `tokensUsed` from
      `CompletionResponse.usage` via `calculateCost()`)
- [ ] WebSocket event delivery verification tests

## [0.7.3] - 2026-06-16

### Security

- **Resolved all production dependency vulnerabilities.** Bumped 6 vulnerable dependencies via pnpm overrides: hono 4.12.21 → 4.12.25 (CORS wildcard reflection, Windows path traversal, Lambda cookie/header issues), ws → ≥8.21.0 (memory exhaustion DoS), form-data → ≥4.0.6 (CRLF injection), protobufjs → ≥8.6.0 (DoS via unbounded Any expansion), nodemailer → ≥8.0.9 (CRLF header injection), dompurify → ≥3.4.9 (multiple XSS bypasses). Also bumped @babel/core to ≥7.29.6 (arbitrary file read via sourceMappingURL) and removed a stale vite 7.3.3 override that caused 19 phantom Dependabot alerts. `pnpm audit` now reports 0 vulnerabilities.

### Fixed

- **Dashboard AI briefing tests** now match the 5-argument `getOrCreateChatAgent` signature (includes `conversationId` for briefing isolation).
- **Rate limit middleware tests** now set `TRUSTED_PROXY=true` + `TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS` via `vi.hoisted()` so the rate-limit code path is exercised instead of short-circuited for local/direct connections.
- **Workflow notification test** replaced `vi.doMock` with a top-level `vi.mock` — the dynamic import of `ws/server.js` was cached from prior tests, so `vi.doMock` never intercepted it.

### Changed

- **Synced 18 provider catalogs** from models.dev (new models: Kimi K2.7 Code, GLM-5.2, Gemma 4 E4B/E2B, MiniMax M3, Nemotron 3 Ultra, Grok Build 0.1; default rotations, price corrections, capability metadata, delisted models).

### Styles

- **Applied Prettier formatting** to 22 unformatted files across the agentic layer (core, gateway, cli, ui) and related dashboard/UI files.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed

- **Plan cancellation is now prompt during parallel wave execution.** When every concurrency slot was full of slow steps, a cancelled plan kept spinning the `maxConcurrent` slot-wait until a step happened to finish — the wave-top abort check couldn't fire while the inner scheduling loop held control. The slot-wait (and the step-scheduling loop) now re-check `signal.aborted` and stop scheduling new steps immediately. Already-scheduled steps are still awaited via `Promise.all` before the abort is surfaced, so no in-flight promise is orphaned (which would otherwise become an unhandled rejection).

## [0.7.1] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed

- **Job-queue worker no longer leaks unhandled promise rejections on DB errors.** `JobQueueService` runs `executeJob` and `pollWorker` fire-and-forget from three callsites; only `pollAll` isolated rejections (via `allSettled`). A transient DB failure while finalizing a job (`repo.complete`/`repo.fail`) or claiming one (`repo.claimJob`) therefore surfaced as an unhandled rejection — a misleading "Unhandled Promise Rejection" log with no job context. `executeJob` now swallows + logs its own persistence errors (never rejects), and the immediate-start and per-job re-poll go through a `safePoll` wrapper that catches `pollWorker` rejections. The worker still frees the slot and re-polls in every case.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- **Personal memory now has an always-on retention schedule.** Previously, personal-memory decay and cleanup ran only via manual REST calls or user-enabled triggers — there was no default daily enforcement (unlike the autonomous Claw runtime, which already trims its own tables daily). A new daily scheduler runs importance decay + dead-memory cleanup automatically. It is pure hygiene — no LLM calls, no conversation extraction, no semantic consolidation — and only removes already-dead entries (importance below 0.1, older than 90 days, and untouched for 90 days), so it runs by default while the LLM-driven `memory_extract` / `memory_consolidate` triggers stay opt-in. Cleanup (an idempotent delete) runs on startup and daily; the compounding decay step runs only on the daily tick, so it stays independent of how often the process restarts.

### Fixed

- **UI shipped unstyled when the Tailwind native scanner fell back to WASM.** Tailwind v4 scans sources with the native `@tailwindcss/oxide` addon; when its platform binary fails to load (a corrupt `@tailwindcss/oxide-win32-x64-msvc` install — missing `package.json` — on Windows), oxide silently falls back to its WASM build, which scans nothing and emits a utility-less ~13 KB stylesheet instead of ~250 KB, with no error. A new build-only `css-size-guard` Vite plugin now **fails the build** if total emitted CSS is under 80 KB, so this can never silently ship (including in Docker images) again.
- **Skills uninstall now hard-deletes files from disk.** Skills were stored both as a `user_extensions` row and as files in a scanned directory; uninstall only removed the row, so the boot scan re-imported them. Managed/personal/workspace-tier skills now have their directory removed on uninstall (bundled skills stay marker-only).
- **Compiled `vite.config` no longer shadows the source.** `tsconfig.node.json` was emitting `vite.config.js`/`.d.ts` next to the source and both were committed; Vite resolves `.js` before `.ts`, so `pnpm dev` silently loaded the stale compiled config. The emit is redirected to a cache dir and the artifacts are gitignored — `vite.config.ts` is now the single source for both dev and build.

### Changed

- **Maintainability sweep (internal, no behavior change).** A Knip-driven pass removed 15 unused files, 4 dead functions, and a long tail of unused type/value exports across core, cli, gateway, ui, and the website; `knip.json` was made accurate across all workspaces (unused-files 63 → 0). Two genuine runtime import cycles were broken in core (costs, plugins). Several oversized files were split into focused co-located modules — `ChatPage`, `TemplateGallery` (1379 → 122 lines), `CodingAgentsPage`, `McpServersPage` (1425 → 1089), `SystemPage`, and `ProfilePage` (1641 → ~1270) — extracting pure data, constants, URL-safety helpers (with new tests), and self-contained presentational components.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-04

### Security

A sustained hardening campaign (manual audits 2026-05-30 → 2026-06-04) across all four packages. Highlights:

- **Core sandbox host-Function RCE escape closed.** A second escape path (beyond the 0.5.1 constructor-chain fix) let sandboxed code reach the host `Function` constructor; now blocked at both the context-injection and code-validator layers.
- **Critical RCE + High findings remediated** from the 2026-06-01 scan (CI actions pinned to commit SHAs, OpenAPI docs disabled in production by default, persisted error-stack length capped, dev UI container hardened).
- **IDOR sweep.** Owner-scoping enforced on previously-unscoped endpoints: notification send + preferences, CLI providers `PUT`/`DELETE`/`test`, channel-user management (`approve`/`block`/`unblock`/`unverify`/`delete`), plus IDOR-004 through IDOR-019. The single-user `default` owner guard no longer 401-loops legitimate access.
- **SSRF.** Sandbox network `fetch` now defaults to an SSRF-safe wrapper instead of raw `globalThis.fetch`; IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses are treated as private; RSS feed fetches routed through `safeFetch` to close a redirect-based SSRF.
- **Filesystem sandbox.** Scoped-fs workspace jail resolves symlinks (including for non-existent paths); PDF and image tool I/O confined to the workspace; local-executor output bounded during streaming.
- **Channels.** `/connect` single-use tokens claimed atomically (TOCTOU); redelivered inbound webhooks deduplicated before paid AI routing; bridge filter patterns rejected when ReDoS-prone; Telegram tool-approval clicks must originate from the prompt's own chat; pairing key no longer disclosed to unclaimed-bot messagers; Discord/Slack/Matrix `connect()` guarded against double-connect handle leaks.
- **Auth / transport.** WebSocket auth key-length timing side-channel closed (timing-safe compare); password-change cutoff enforced on the session cache-hit path; WS self-origins forced to HTTPS with a production origin warning.
- **Coding agents / CLI.** Gateway secrets no longer leak into spawned CLI environments (both `child_process` and Claude Code SDK paths); Windows `cmd.exe` arguments escaped to prevent command injection.
- **Privacy.** PII detector match loop guarded against infinite loops; overlapping matches coalesced so redaction can't leak through gaps.
- **Plugins / skills.** Isolated-fetch response size cap enforced while streaming; npm skill installer redirects capped to prevent infinite recursion; a loud warning is emitted when a signed manifest is verified without an integrity check.
- **Budget.** Pre-spend enforcement added on the chat route (BUDGET-001/002); soul monthly budget cap now enforced (previously only the daily cap was).

## [0.7.4] - 2026-06-17

### Phase 2A — Large file splits

Substantial structural refactoring. All splits preserve barrel re-exports so no call sites change.

- **`services/claw/manager.ts`** (1739→30 LOC barrel, −1709 LOC): split into `manager/` sub-directory:
  `manager/constants.ts` (constants, enum maps, lifecycle state machine), `manager/events.ts` (event helpers),
  `manager/singleton.ts` (singleton factory with reset), `manager/manager.ts` (remaining orchestration).
  Backward-compatible barrel re-exports all public exports.
- **`services/workflow/workflow-service.ts`** (1704→1068 LOC, −636 LOC): extracted `workflow-dispatch.ts`
  (dispatchNode with all 20 node-type branches, executeWithRetryAndTimeout, ApprovalPauseError).
  Uses DispatchCallbacks interface for sub-workflow recursion.
- **`services/agent/service.ts`** (1200→806 LOC, −394 LOC): extracted `agent-session-info.ts` and
  `agent-context.ts`. Circular deps broken by extracting getSessionInfo first; compactContext
  and related helpers now in their own module.
- **`db/repositories/workflows/index.ts`** (959→~485 LOC, −474 LOC): extracted `workflow-types.ts`
  (domain types, node data variants, row types, row mappers). Barrel re-exports all types unchanged.

**Net: −3213 LOC across 9 new modules.** No public API changes.

### Phase 2B — Sub-path exports

- Added sub-path exports to `core/package.json`: `@ownpilot/core/services/claw` (24 exports),
  `@ownpilot/core/services/coding-agent` (21 exports), `@ownpilot/core/services/registry` (7 exports).
- Added ESLint `no-restricted-imports` rule flagging claw/coding-agent symbol imports from bare
  `@ownpilot/core/services`. Migration enforced per-file via pre-commit hook.
- Migrated 6 files as pattern examples (`claw/manager.ts`, `claw/routes/claws.ts`, and 4 extracted modules).

### Type safety

- **`stringifyToolResult(undefined)` type bug fixed**: JSON.stringify returns `undefined` (not the
  string `'undefined'`). Function now correctly returns `string | undefined` and handles null/undefined
  inputs by returning `undefined`.
- **eval() investigation closed**: Flagged "4 eval() calls in production" were all `page.$eval()`
  (Puppeteer DOM API) — not JavaScript's eval(). All real eval() usage correctly blocked by
  the security layer. Updated `refactor-next.md`.

### Test coverage expansion

- Added 63 tests across 9 new test files for previously untested services:
  `claw/manager-failure.ts`, `claw/manager-helpers.ts`, `retention-service.ts`, `provider/health.ts`,
  `usage-tracking.ts`, `claw/manager-task-plan.ts`, `llm/semaphore.ts`, `metric/service.ts`,
  `shutdown-cleanup.ts`.
- All 10 highest-priority untested gateway services now covered.

### Dependencies

- **`ws`** → `>=8.21.0` (memory exhaustion DoS from tiny fragments — exploitable on exposed WebSocket servers).
- **`form-data`** → `>=4.0.6` (CRLF injection via multipart fields — via `@slack/web-api`).
- **`hono`** → `4.12.25` (5 advisories: CORS origin reflection, Windows path traversal, body limit bypass,
  Lambda cookie/header issues — most impactful was CORS reflect-anything with credentials).
- **`protobufjs`** → `>=8.6.0` (DoS via unbounded Any expansion, schema name shadowing — via `@whiskeysockets/baileys`).
- **`nodemailer`** → `>=8.0.9` (CRLF header injection, jsonTransport file access bypass).
- **`dompurify`** → `>=3.4.9` (mXSS bypass, mutation XSS, namespace confusion — 9 advisories cleared).
- **`@babel/core`** → `>=7.29.6` (low-severity arbitrary code execution in template literals).
- Removed stale **`vite`** `7.3.3` override — UI already uses `vite@8.0.16` which is not vulnerable.
  This eliminated 108 phantom lockfile entries and their transitive dependency tree.

**Result**: `pnpm audit` reports 0 production vulnerabilities (was 20).

### Testing

- Fixed `rate-limit/middleware.test.ts`: added `TRUSTED_PROXY=true` + `TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS` via
  `vi.hoisted()` before module eval — rate-limit code path was bypassed because getClientIp returned
  `'direct'` without trusted proxy config.
- Fixed `dashboard/index.test.ts`: updated `getOrCreateChatAgent` call assertions to match 5-argument
  signature (`provider, model, undefined, null, tag`).
- Fixed `workflow/executors/node-executors.test.ts`: replaced `vi.doMock` (no-op after module load)
  with `vi.mock` for WebSocket broadcast mock. All 98 workflow executor tests now pass.

### Refactored

- **`refactor-next.md`** updated: Phase 2A progress (5/6 targets complete), Phase 2B sub-path exports
  added and ESLint migration rule active, eval() false positive resolved.

### Added

- **Capability accessor architecture.** Every `Services.X` registry token now has a matching `getXService()` / `setXService()` / `hasXService()` accessor (30/30). A new `RuntimeContext` bundles the horizontal capabilities (LLM router, channels, config, events, permissions, memory, audit) that every autonomous runtime needs; Claw and Soul Heartbeat consume it explicitly for mockable dependencies.
- **Dynamic provider discovery.** Provider listings now read the `data/providers/` directory (140 synced model catalogs from models.dev) instead of a hardcoded list, so newly-synced providers surface without code changes.
- **Claw guardrail enforcement + learning loop.** `ClawAutonomyPolicy` is now enforced at tool-call time (was prompt-only); completed runs are auto-distilled into reusable `claw-learned` skills (`claw_save_skill` / `claw_recall_skill`), with ShareGPT trajectory export, browser accessibility-tree mode, and programmatic tool calling (`claw_execute`).
- **Startup security enforcement.** `enforceSecurityConfig()` is wired into server boot — mode-aware Docker requirement (hard-fails only when `EXECUTION_MODE=docker`) plus dangerous-env-var checks in production.
- **Browser tools** — `browser_navigate_back` and `browser_hover`.
- **Cross-channel bridges** — UCP bridges wired into the live message pipeline with bot-origin + self-target loop guards.

### Changed

- **Single-tenant model.** Gateway route handlers use a fixed `LOCAL_OWNER_ID` (`'default'`) instead of per-request user resolution; residual ownership guards are retained so cross-owner resources still 404.
- **Cost pricing** falls back to synced provider-JSON pricing for models absent from the static table (so e.g. Cohere bills at real price instead of $0); the static table stays primary.
- **Source tree reorganized** into family subdirectories under `services/`, `routes/`, `tools/`, and `db/repositories/`; file prefixes dropped inside each family.

### Fixed

- **Extensions** — removal-marker queries cast params to `::text` to fix Postgres "could not determine data type of parameter" errors (the feature was silently non-functional).
- **Plans** — a user-aborted running plan is persisted as `cancelled`, not overwritten to `failed`.
- **Autonomy** — the pulse timer re-arms when a scheduled tick overlaps a manual pulse (previously the autonomous loop silently died until restart).
- **Workflow** — approval pauses are no longer finalized as `failed` (approvals were entirely broken); conditional/switch skips no longer swallow downstream rejoin/merge nodes; the execution lock is released when run setup throws.
- **Triggers** — schedule and condition triggers advance their cursor on failure too, so a throwing trigger no longer hot-loops every poll.
- **Channels** — error paths replace the dangling "Thinking…" placeholder instead of orphaning it; SMS/Matrix long replies are split instead of truncated; `/model` and cost tracking use the real resolved model.
- **Coding agents** — `terminateSession` fires completion callbacks (waiters no longer hang); the PTY is disposed on error/timeout, not just clean exit; ACP terminal state is guarded against overwrite; cancellation is honored instead of being overwritten with `completed`.
- **ACP** — `AcpClient.close()` and `TerminalManager` now have working SIGKILL fallbacks.
- **WebSocket** — idle-session reaping unsubscribes EventBus listeners (was leaking up to 50 listeners per dropped client); the UI no longer auto-reconnects after an intentional close.
- **Edge** — MQTT `+` wildcard requires a present level; reconnect ends the prior client and guards stale handlers.
- **Claw** — mid-cycle inbox messages are preserved when the inbox is at its cap.
- **Concurrency** — the scheduler never runs the same task concurrently with itself; the job pool serializes `pollWorker` so a worker can't exceed its concurrency; batch embeddings enforce a 1:1 input/output count.
- **Compaction** — the DB mirror is skipped when there's nothing older to summarize.
- **Postgres** — per-connection timeouts are applied via libpq `options` startup params instead of a racing `SET`.
- **Extensions** — `recover()` clears the error state after a successful reload.

### Removed

- **Fleet, Subagent, and Orchestra subsystems removed.** These three autonomous-agent surfaces overlapped with existing primitives without adding unique value: Fleet's "worker army" was covered by Claw's concurrent cycles + `claw_spawn_subclaw` and Workflow's `parallelNode`; Subagent's ephemeral spawn was covered by `claw_spawn_subclaw` and Crew's `delegate_task`; Orchestra was tightly coupled to Subagent and couldn't survive its removal. Migration 038 drops `fleets`, `fleet_sessions`, `fleet_tasks`, `fleet_worker_history`, `subagent_history`, and `orchestra_executions`. The mental model is now **Agent (base) → Claw (unified runtime) → Soul/Crew/Heartbeat (persistent team identity)** with Workflow and Coding Agents as separate paradigms.
- **Dead-code sweep** — a Knip-driven pass removed ~1,700 lines of unused exports, dead singletons, and phantom dependencies (gateway unused exports: 225 → 27).

### Dependencies

- `react-router-dom` → `^7.16.0` (resolves 5 CVEs).

## [0.5.1] - 2026-05-22

### Security

Forensic audit pass on `packages/core`. 11 CRITICAL+HIGH findings; all closed.

- **CRITICAL — sandbox host-realm RCE via constructor chain.** Verified end-to-end: before this fix, plugin code running in `WorkerSandbox` could execute `new URL('http://x').constructor.constructor('return process.versions.node')()` and obtain real host-realm `process` access. The injected host `URL` (and `URLSearchParams`, `TextEncoder`, `TextDecoder`, `Response`, `Request`, `Headers`) walked into the host `Function` constructor, which compiles strings in the host realm and is NOT governed by `vm.createContext`'s `codeGeneration.strings:false`. Three-layer fix in `core/sandbox/context.ts` + `core/sandbox/code-validator.ts`: (a) stop injecting V8-already-provided constructors (`Date`, `RegExp`, `Error`, `JSON`, `Math`, typed arrays, `DataView`) — the VM context provides its own safe versions; (b) Proxy-wrap the Node-only host constructors V8 doesn't supply, returning a sandbox-realm stub Proxy from `.constructor` that recursively returns itself and throws on call; (c) extend the static code-validator regex to catch the `'construct'+'or'` string-concat bypass.
- **CRITICAL — `SecurePluginRuntime` removed.** The legacy runtime in `core/plugins/runtime.ts` advertised plugin isolation but provided none: its worker had `eval: true` with full Node access, `pluginModule` was never assigned (so every `call()` returned "Method not found"), and the entire API had zero callers in gateway/cli/ui. Deleted the file, its 1,500-line test, and the corresponding re-exports from `core/plugins/index.ts`. The functional plugin system is `PluginRegistry`.
- **CRITICAL — WorkerSandbox concurrency race.** Two concurrent `execute()` calls both passed the `state !== 'idle'` check after the lazy-init `await`; the second overwrote `currentResolve`/`currentReject`/`executionTimeout` — the first promise hung forever. Now serialized via a sync busy-flag + queue; uncontended calls still run inline so the synchronous `worker.postMessage` side-effect is preserved.
- **HIGH — Plugin network SSRF (no DNS resolution).** `PluginIsolatedNetwork.fetch` only checked literal IPv4 octets, so `evil.com` whose A record points at `169.254.169.254` (cloud-metadata endpoint) sailed past the guard. Added DNS resolution via `node:dns/promises` with 1-minute block cache, IPv4-mapped-IPv6 and CGNAT (`100.64.0.0/10`) ranges in the static check, redirect-target re-check, and fail-closed on unresolvable hostnames.
- **HIGH — Unbounded parallel tool execution.** `ToolRegistry.executeToolCalls` did `Promise.allSettled` with no concurrency cap; an LLM (possibly driven by prompt injection) could return 100+ tool calls in a turn and spawn sandboxes, hit paid APIs, and drain rate limits in parallel. Capped at 8 concurrent via an index-based worker pool.
- **HIGH — HookBus has no per-handler timeout.** A handler that never resolves used to block the entire chain and every awaiting caller (e.g. `tool:before-execute` blocked every tool call). Each handler is now raced against a 5-second timeout; the chain continues with the offender skipped.
- **HIGH — Memory store path traversal via userId.** `ConversationMemoryStore` and `PersonalMemoryStore` joined `userId` directly into the storage path; a caller passing `../../../etc/foo` escaped the per-user partition. Added `assertSafeUserId(/^[A-Za-z0-9_.-]{1,128}$/)` in both constructors.
- **HIGH — `SecureMemoryStore` empty salt default.** `loadOrCreateSalt()` resolved the salt and used it to derive the encryption key, but never propagated it back to `config.installationSalt` — so `hashUserId()` and `hashContent()` silently used the empty-string default, making both hashes deterministic and identical across every OwnPilot install on earth. Defeats the per-installation isolation property. Now propagated.
- **HIGH — `CredentialContext` plaintext cache TTL.** Decrypted credential plaintext used to linger in the cache forever in long-lived services (background workers, soul heartbeat). Entries now expire after 5 minutes.
- **HIGH — Silent random encryption key.** `createInMemoryCredentialStore` silently generated a random key when none was configured. If a persistent backend was swapped in, all credentials would be unreadable after restart. Now throws in `NODE_ENV=production`; emits a loud warning otherwise.
- **HIGH — Worker exit cross-plugin pending-call leak.** When one plugin's worker exited, the runtime iterated the global `pendingCalls` map and rejected EVERY in-flight call, including those belonging to other plugins. Now tagged with `pluginId` and scoped to the exiting plugin only.

### Fixed

- **WhatsApp channel resilience (440 displace storm).** `consecutive440Count` was reset on every successful `'open'` event, which defeated `MAX_CONSECUTIVE_440=3` during brief-reconnect storms. Now deferred behind a 2-minute stable-connection window so a flapping connection cannot zero the counter on every cycle.
- **Telegram channel resilience (409 conflict storm).** Symmetric to the WhatsApp fix: `reconnectAttempts = 0` in `onStart` was deferred behind the same 2-minute stable-connection window, so `RECONNECT_CONFIG.maxAttempts=10` can no longer be defeated by a 409 conflict bouncing the poller between brief successes.

### Removed

- `SecurePluginRuntime`, `createPluginRuntime`, `getDefaultRuntime`, `resetDefaultRuntime`, `type PluginState`, `type PluginInstance`, `type LoadOptions`, `type RuntimeConfig`, `type RuntimeEvents`, and class `PluginSecurityBarrier` from `@ownpilot/core/plugins`. Net diff: -2,489 lines. External consumers should migrate to `PluginRegistry` (already used internally).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- **Tunnel system** — Full tunnel wizard, service, routes, and UI for exposing local services securely.
- **OpenAPI 3.1 spec** — Auto-generated OpenAPI document with embedded Swagger UI explorer for gateway endpoints.
- **Pulse Engine: claw monitoring** — Claw runtime state surfaced through the Pulse Engine.
- **Heartbeat: full feature set** — Circuit breaker, retries, metrics, and forecasting layered onto the soul heartbeat service.
- **Claws: 8 new management tools** — `pause_claw`, `resume_claw`, `update_claw`, `delete_claw`, `doctor_claw`, `apply_fixes_claw`, `restart_claw`, plus one additional management primitive.
- **Claws: LLM concurrency slot limiter** — Bounded provider parallelism with live UI feedback in `ClawsPage`.
- **Claws UI rework** — Sidebar tabs, header start/stop/pause controls, dedicated Runs tab, Schedules tab for interval/mode monitoring, enriched Overview/Stats/Skills/Config/Doctor/Audit/Conversation/Output tabs (search, filters, expanded views, JSON export), bulk start/pause and escalations batch approve/deny, needs-attention badge in header, live output feed, interval config in CreateClawModal and ClawCard, AI mission assist in CreateClawModal and SettingsTab.
- **FileBrowser enrichment** — In-tree search, folder creation, and folder toggle.
- **ClawCard enrichment** — Skills, coding agent, and preset badges surfaced on each card.

### Changed

- Bumped OwnPilot workspace packages from `0.4.0` to `0.5.0` for the next minor release.

### Fixed

- **Channel resilience** — Both WhatsApp (`consecutive440Count`) and Telegram (`reconnectAttempts`) now defer the on-success counter reset behind a 2-minute stable-connection window. A 409/440 displace storm with brief successful opens between conflicts can no longer zero the counter on every cycle and loop past `maxAttempts`.
- **8 CRITICAL gateway findings** — Transaction boundaries, semaphore correctness, retention sweeps, and schema/DB mismatches across hot paths.
- **Database hardening** — Authorization scoping, deterministic ordering, missing row locks, JSONB tag handling, OFFSET caps, and batch-insert correctness across multiple repositories.
- **Multi-tenant authz** — `conversations.getAll` scoped by `userId`, claws scans capped, three additional cross-tenant leaks closed, SSE cancel signals propagated, bridges route updated to `repo.listForUser(userId)`.
- **Chat** — Accurate context-window resolution via `resolveContextWindow` / `resolveMaxOutput` / `computeMemoryMaxTokens` (synced from models.dev, no hardcoded limits). Durable auto-compact mirrors compaction to the database so it survives gateway restart / agent eviction; concurrency guard rechecks message count after summarization to refuse mid-flight collisions.
- **Concurrency** — Singleton timers now stop in graceful shutdown; race-safe conversation create with dead cache deletes removed; orchestrator cancel propagated through stream tear-down; single `--disallowed-tools` flag; pre-flight LLM API-key check.
- **WebSocket** — Backpressure guard on broadcast/send drops slow clients instead of unbounded queueing.
- **Fleet / MQTT** — Orphan detection, true round-robin scheduling, MQTT host fallback.
- **Tunnel routes** — `apiResponse`/`apiError` envelope normalization and input validation.
- **Gateway routing** — Route ordering fix, dead code removed, load all env files.
- **UI** — WS event names, trigger validation, subagents nav; artifact card view truncates long markdown with scroll; ArtifactDetailModal iframe auto-height for HTML/SVG and fills full height; skip-home targets `tools` tab (not `customtools`); FleetPage refetch coalescing; radix and v2 copy polish; ZoneEditor docs.

### Security

- **Token hygiene** — `pg_dump` output redaction, bootstrap token minimum length raised to 32, API-key comparison via timing-safe SHA-256 digest, JWT lifetime bounded with `requiredClaims: ['iat']` + `maxTokenAge`.
- **SSRF DNS-rebinding** — Shared `utils/ssrf.ts` (`isBlockedUrl` + `isPrivateUrlAsync` with 1-minute cache) covers `browser-service`, `/chat/fetch-url`, and `web-fetch` executors; `call_json_api` now in `PERMISSION_GATED_TOOLS` with the `network` permission.
- **Sandbox / signing** — Sandbox constructor escape closed; webhook signing hardened (HMAC + timestamp freshness).
- **Trusted-proxy gating** — `getRequestOrigin` / `getRequestUrl` / `isSecureRequest` honor `X-Forwarded-*` only when `TRUSTED_PROXY=true` and the connection IP is in `TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS`.
- **Extension privilege boundaries** — Skill script bridges gated behind `OWNPILOT_ENABLE_SKILL_SCRIPTS`; `git_branch` added to `BLOCKED_CALLABLE_TOOLS`.
- **Access control** — AUTH-001 through AUTH-003 closed.

### Performance

- **N+1 collapse** — `GET /acc/analytics` and `GET /acc/status` batch heartbeat lookups (N+1 → 1).
- **Hot-path indexes** — Composite indexes for `channel_messages` hot queries; composite + partial indexes for two additional polling queries.

### Dependencies

- `vite` → `7.3.3` (postcss XSS + path traversal/file read; also collapses duplicate `rollup` in UI build).
- `postcss` → `8.5.10` (CVE-2026-41305 XSS in `website`).
- `hono` → `4.12.21` (2 medium CVEs).
- `axios` → `1.16.1` (13 medium CVEs).
- `turbo` → `2.9.14` (2 medium CVEs).
- `protobufjs` → `7.6.0`.
- All vulnerable dependencies pinned to exact fixed versions via `pnpm.overrides`.

### CI

- Added a `Build @ownpilot/core` step before the migration smoke test so the smoke test can resolve `@ownpilot/core/dist/index.js`.

### Tests

- `bridges.test.ts` mock updated to match the user-scoped `repo.listForUser(userId)` route signature; added coverage for cross-tenant filtering.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- **Release scripts** - Added root `pnpm run` commands for version inspection, semver bumps, release preflight checks, release notes extraction, verification, tagging, and publishing.
- **Cross-platform release helpers** - Added Node-based scripts for version bumping, release checks, changelog-based notes, and annotated Git tag creation.
- **Release documentation** - Documented the expanded command list and the minor release workflow in the README.

### Changed

- Bumped OwnPilot workspace packages from `0.3.2` to `0.4.0` for the next minor release.
- Updated architecture metadata and release documentation to match the `0.4.0` release train.

### Fixed

- Avoided passing an explicit `undefined` stream options argument when executing workflows without an abort signal.
- Aligned extension uninstall responses and middleware persistence tests with current gateway behavior.

### Release

- `pnpm release:check` validates workspace version alignment, changelog coverage, and release workflow presence.
- `pnpm release:verify` runs release preflight, production audit, build, typecheck, lint, and tests before tagging.
- `pnpm release:verify:strict` adds the full repository format check for CI parity.
- `pnpm release:notes` prints the current version's changelog section for GitHub release notes.

### Security

- Updated pnpm overrides for `fast-uri` and `protobufjs` to patched versions required by the production audit gate.

## [0.2.9] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- **Mini Pomodoro Timer** — Compact countdown widget in the global header bar, visible on all pages when a Pomodoro session is active. Shows progress ring, session type icon, and countdown. Click to navigate to Pomodoro page. Auto-hides when no session is running or when on the Pomodoro page itself.
- **MiniPomodoro component** (`packages/ui/src/components/MiniPomodoro.tsx`) — Self-contained component with WebSocket updates and independent countdown

### Fixed

- **Pomodoro Timer Broken on Non-UTC Machines** — Root cause: PostgreSQL `TIMESTAMP` (without timezone) columns + `pg` driver's default parser interprets stored values as local time. On non-UTC machines, `startedAt` was shifted backward, causing `fetchState()` to calculate `remaining = 0` and immediately auto-complete every session. Fix: `pg.types.setTypeParser(1114)` forces UTC interpretation for all timestamp columns.
- **Pomodoro Timer Effect** — Removed `timeLeft` from the timer `useEffect` dependency array, which was needlessly recreating the interval every second
- **CI: notification-router.test.ts** — Test was hitting real PostgreSQL (port 25432) instead of mocks after preferences were migrated to DB-backed storage. Added `settingsRepo` mock with in-memory Map.
- **Code Formatting** — Fixed 88 files with Prettier formatting issues that were failing `format:check` in CI

- **Circular Dependencies (core)** — Broke fragile `tool-validation ↔ tools` cycle with lazy import (was last remaining dangerous cycle)
- **Circular Dependencies (gateway)** — Broke 45+ cycles across 4 root causes: `agents↔ws/server` (lazy import), `tool-providers↔routes` (cached lazy executors), `webchat-handler↔server` (lazy import), `normalizers barrel` (extracted types.ts)

### Changed

- ToolPalette sidebar now shows all 23 node types
- NodeSearchPalette includes 6 new node types
- Node config router dispatches to 23 panel types
- All normalizers import from `types.ts` instead of barrel `index.ts`

- **Delay Node** — Logs warning when 1-hour safety cap is applied
- **Agent Concurrent Guard** — `cycleInProgress` flag prevents double cycle execution
- **Agent Rate Limit Retry** — Re-schedules with backoff after throttling (was silently stopping)
- **Agent Crew Context Cache** — 30-second TTL cache reduces N\*3 DB queries per heartbeat to 1
- **getCommunicationBus()** — Throws descriptive error instead of unsafe non-null assertion crash
- **Subagent spawnCounts** — Cleaned up when conversations have no active sessions (was growing unbounded)
- **Workspace Creation** — Warning logged instead of silent debug on failure

### Changed

- Extracted `agent-runner-utils.ts` — shared tool registration, agent factory, model resolution, timeout, JSON parsing (~360 LOC dedup)
- Centralized scheduling constants (`config/defaults.ts`) — `MANAGER_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_ERRORS`, `MANAGER_SESSION_PERSIST_INTERVAL_MS`, per-system delay bounds
- `AutonomousAgentResult` base interface for unified result types across all runners

## [0.1.3] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- **Model Routing** — Per-process model selection (chat, telegram, pulse) with provider fallback chains, configurable via API and UI
- **Extended Thinking** — Anthropic extended thinking support with configurable budget tokens for deeper reasoning
- **Sidebar Reorganization** — Navigation menus reordered by usage frequency: daily items at top, power-user features in collapsible groups, settings ordered by domain

### Fixed

- **Telegram FK Constraint** — Second message after server restart failed with `channel_sessions_conversation_id_fkey` violation; conversation recovery now persists to DB before updating FK (fixes #7)
- **Dashboard Streaming** — Null model parameter caused TypeScript build failures in `generateAIBriefingStreaming`
- **Expenses Page** — Feb-31 date bug when filtering by month; added edit support with modal form
- **SystemPage Polling** — Database operation status polling leaked timers on unmount; added ref-based cleanup
- **ApiKeysPage** — Default model save silently swallowed errors; now shows toast feedback
- **AutonomyPage** — `Promise.all` → `Promise.allSettled` so partial API failures don't blank the page
- **ModelsPage** — Settings link pointed to `/settings` instead of `/settings/api-keys`
- **WorkspacesPage** — Empty workspace badge showed for workspaces with 1 file (should be 0)
- **CalendarPage** — No validation when end date/time was before start
- **TasksPage** — Missing `cancelled` status in filter and visual styling
- **SKILL.md Parser** — Improved YAML metadata parsing for block sequences and nested maps

### Changed

- Config Center: removed 5 orphaned seed services (Deepgram, DeepL, Tavily, Serper, Perplexity) with no built-in consumer code
- Gateway routes: `parseJsonBody` helper adopted across all route modules
- Dev dependencies bumped: ESLint 10.0.2, Turbo 2.8.11, typescript-eslint 8.56.1
- `.gitignore`: broader protection patterns for stray generated files

## [0.1.2] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- **CLI Tools Platform** — 40+ discoverable CLI tools with automatic PATH-based binary detection, categorization (linters, formatters, build tools, package managers, security scanners, databases, containers), and version detection
- **Per-Tool Security Policies** — `allowed` (auto-execute), `prompt` (require approval), `blocked` (reject) per user per tool, with batch policy updates via API
- **Dynamic Risk Scoring** — Catalog-based risk levels (low/medium/high/critical) feed into the autonomy risk engine, overriding generic tool risk scores
- **Custom CLI Tool Registration** — Register any binary as a CLI tool with category and risk metadata via `POST /cli-tools/custom`
- **CLI Policy Approval Integration** — Per-tool policies wired into the real-time approval flow in the orchestrator, dynamic risk scoring based on catalog risk levels
- **Coding Agents** — Orchestrate external AI coding CLIs (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI) with session management, real-time terminal output streaming, and result persistence
- **Dual Execution Modes** — Auto mode (headless `child_process.spawn`) and interactive mode (PTY terminal) for coding agents
- **Custom Coding Agent Providers** — Register any CLI binary as a coding agent provider via the CLI Providers API
- **Model Routing** — Per-process model selection (chat, telegram, pulse) with fallback chains, configurable via API and UI
- **Extended Thinking** — Anthropic extended thinking support for deeper reasoning in complex tasks

### Changed

- Gateway route modules: 40 → 43 top-level (added `coding-agents.ts`, `cli-tools.ts`, `cli-providers.ts`, `model-routing.ts`)
- Repositories: 37 → 41 (added `coding-agent-results`, `cli-providers`, `cli-tool-policies`, `autonomy-log`)
- UI pages: 41 → 47 (added CodingAgentsPage, CodingAgentSettingsPage, CliToolsSettingsPage, ModelRoutingPage, SecurityPage, AboutPage)
- WebSocket events: added `coding-agent:session:*` for coding agent lifecycle

### Testing

- 315+ test files, 19,200+ tests total
- New: coding-agent-service, coding-agent-sessions, cli-providers, cli-tool-policies, coding-agent-results repository tests

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- **Pulse System** — Autonomous AI-driven engine that proactively gathers context, evaluates signals, invokes the LLM, executes actions, and reports results on an adaptive timer (5–15 min)
- **Pulse Directives** — Configurable evaluation rules, action cooldowns, blocked actions, custom instructions, and 4 preset templates (Balanced, Conservative, Proactive, Minimal)
- **Pulse Execution Lock** — Prevents concurrent pulse execution; manual and auto pulses share the same lock
- **Pulse Activity Broadcasting** — Real-time WebSocket `pulse:activity` events with stage progression (starting → gathering → evaluating → deciding → executing → reporting → done)
- **Pulse Activity Monitor (UI)** — Live activity banner with stage name and elapsed time, "Run Now" button disables during pulse, 409 toast on concurrent attempts
- **Pulse History & Stats** — Paginated pulse log with signal IDs, urgency scores, action results, and expandable details
- **Pulse Route Guard** — `POST /pulse/run` returns 409 `ALREADY_RUNNING` when a pulse is in progress

### Changed

- `AutonomyEngine.getStatus()` now includes `activePulse` field (null when idle)
- Broadcaster in `server.ts` routes `pulse:activity` events separately from `system:notification`

### Testing

- 315 test files, 19,100+ tests total
- New: 5 engine execution lock tests + 2 route guard tests
