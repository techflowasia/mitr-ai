/**
 * RuntimeContext — the canonical bundle of capabilities a runtime needs.
 *
 * Every autonomous runtime (Claw, Soul Heartbeat, Chat, Workflow, etc.)
 * needs access to roughly the same horizontal capabilities:
 *   - pick an LLM and ask about its context window / cost
 *   - send and receive on user channels (Telegram, Discord, ...)
 *   - look up service configuration (API keys, bot tokens)
 *   - emit and listen for events
 *
 * Without a bundle, each runtime imports the four getters separately,
 * which means (a) a new runtime forgets one, (b) tests have to set up
 * each capability independently, (c) the dependency surface is implicit.
 *
 * With this bundle, `getRuntimeContext()` returns the "system services"
 * every runtime gets. Runtimes can either pull individual capabilities
 * from it (less typing) or accept a RuntimeContext as a constructor
 * parameter (explicit dependency, easy to mock).
 *
 * IMPORTANT: RuntimeContext is for stateless / process-wide capabilities.
 * Per-call state (userId, conversationId, claw cycle context) belongs
 * in a separate execution context (AsyncLocalStorage or explicit args),
 * NOT here.
