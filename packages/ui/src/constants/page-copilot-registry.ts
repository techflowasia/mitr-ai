/**
 * Page Copilot Registry — maps route section IDs to copilot context configs.
 *
 * Each entry defines:
 *   - pageType: logical page identifier
 *   - resolveContext: async fn that fetches entity-specific data (path, definition, metadata)
 *   - suggestions: canned prompt suggestions shown in the copilot panel
 *   - preferBridge: true for path-based pages where bridge copilot has file-system access
 *   - systemPromptHint: optional extra context injected into the system prompt
 *
 * Adding a new section:
 * 1. Add entry here keyed by the route segment (e.g. 'my-page' for /my-page)
 * 2. For settings sub-pages use the sub-segment (e.g. 'mcp-servers' for /settings/mcp-servers)
